# Electronic Music Genre Classification
Analysis - illustrating different methods for music genre/mood classification. Adapted methods of CNNs and RNNs.

1) Baseline model A - MFCC features with an ensemble based classifier
2) Baseline model B - CNN architecture (Han and Lee, 2015)
3) Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (Serial) (Choi et al, 2016)
4) Convolutional Neural Network <-> Recurrent Neural Network (Parallel) (Feng et al, 2017)

App - hosted final model to serve predictions of submitted track.
